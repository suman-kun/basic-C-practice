# basic-c-practice
## Introduction
This repository is about basic programs on C Programming. Here I'll upload C programs based on Loops, Arrays, Functions, Strings and many other topics.
You can practice basic C programs from here and also add some problems & solutions if it's possible. 

## Acknowledgement
This is my first repository and I want to Thank my friend [Asim Bera](https://github.com/asimbera) and @freecodecamp.org for helping me to learn about Git and Github.
Any valuable suggestion would be much appreciated.
