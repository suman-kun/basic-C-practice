# basic-C-practice
This is my very first repository and is about C Programming. Here I'll upload C programs based on Loops, Arrays, Functions, Strings and many other topics.
You can practice basic C programs from here and also add some problems & solutions if it's possible. 

## Acknowledgement
I want to Thank my friend @asimbera and @freecodecamp.org for helping me to learn about Git and Github.
Any valuable suggestion would be much appreciated.
